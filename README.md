## Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** No. Lunastrap is open source, it's impossible to put malware without anyone noticing. Just download from this github. The only offical source is this Github repository.

**Q: Can i be banned?**

**A:** No. Lunastrap doesn't inject an dll to Roblox or do stuff that exploits do, It is impossible to be banned with Lunastrap.

## Installing

Download the [latest release via clicking this](https://github.com/lunastraplabs/lunastrap/releases/latest), and run it. Do the steps and config you're settings.

You will also need [.NET 6 Desktop Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win11-x64&apphost_version=6.0.16&gui=true). If you don't already have it installed, you'll be prompted to install it anyway. Be sure to install Bloxstrap after you've installed this.

It's not unlikely that Windows Smartscreen will show a popup when you run Lunastrap for the first time. This happens because it's an unknown program, not because it's actually detected as being malicious. To dismiss it, just click on "More info" and then "Run anyway".

Once installed, Lunastrap is added to your Start Menu, where you can access the menu and reconfigure your preferences if needed.

## Code

Lunastrap uses the [WPF UI](https://github.com/lepoco/wpfui) library for the user interface design. We currently use and maintain bloxstrap's own fork of WPF UI at [bloxstraplabs/wpfui](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/wpfui).
